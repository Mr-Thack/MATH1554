# MATH1554


The most important part of MATH 1554 linear algebra is calculating the output vector of a Leontief model. Yep, Leontief models. Just ignore all that eigenvalue stuff and skip straight to the Leontief section. We must use row reduction, the chaddest method of solving linear systems in MATH 1554 linear algebra in order to solve the Leontief problem. You have a problem with Leontief? Go back to precalculus you @aarushmagic.
