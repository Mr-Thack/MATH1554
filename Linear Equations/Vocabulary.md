|:-------------------------:	|:---------------------------------------------------------:	|
|           Consistent          	|if it has at least one solution.|
|       Row equivalent |if a sequence of row operations transforms one matrix into the other.|
| Unique solution | if and only if there are no free variables 	|
| Homogeneous | Linear systems of the form $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$ |
| Inhomogeneous | Linear systems of the form $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ where $\mathbf{b} \neq \mathbf{0}$ |
| Trivial solution | the solution is the zero vector |
| Linearly independent | if no vector can be made from other vectors |
| Row operations | Addition, Interchange, Scaling |
| Pivot position | a leading 1 in the RREF of A |
| Pivot column | is a column of A that contains a pivot position |
| Domain | $T: \mathbb{R}^n$ $\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$; $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the domain of $T$ |
| Codomain | $T: \mathbb{R}^n$ $\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$; $\mathbb{R}^m$ is the codomain of $T$ |
| Image | The vector $T(\vec{x})$ is the image of $\vec{x}$ under $T$ |
| Range | The set of all possible images $T(\vec{x})$ or simply the **span of A** |
|Standard vectors| The normal axes you would use (think $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$)|
