### The leading one's are in first, third, and fifth columns.
- The pivot columns of A are the first, third, and fifth columns
- The corresponding variables of the system $A \vec{x}= \vec{b}$. are $x_1, x_2, \text{and} x_5$ Variables that correspond to a pivot are basic variables.
- Variables that are not basic are free variables. They can take any value.
- The free variables are $x_2$ and $x_4$. Any choice of the free variables leads to a solution of the system.
